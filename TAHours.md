# Teacher Assistant Hours

This is one of the most crucial steps to take when in College.
Teacher Assistants have already taken the class and received an A.

Feedback: Teacher assistants are the ones who grade your labs, projects, and papers. Look through your syllabus and check the hours that each of your assistants are available. Make time to go to campus or meet them on Zoom.
They can contribute to your academic strength.

Test Preparation: TAs help you review tough concepts, how to solve problems with various techniques, and can even hint at possible test questions.

Relationship Building: By going to these sessions, you will most likely meet other people who are struggling to learn a concept as well. During these TA hours make sure to interact with the teacher assistant. It should 
not be a one-way road. These mentors down the road could help you out with recommendation letters and provide general advice.

Shows Initiative: If the teacher and their assistants see you applying yourself in the support hours they provide, you are more likely to be on their good side (as long as you are actively learning).
