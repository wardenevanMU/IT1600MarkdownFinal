# Build Relationships

Attend Social Events: Club Fairs, Orientation Events, and social gatherings are all good options to meet new people. These people generally have the same interests as you.

Study Groups: Take initiative and be the one to start a study group or to join one. Team collaboration is a great way to make lasting relationships. 

Campus Housing: Living on campus your first few years can make building these relationships a bit easier. You can attend residence hall events and get to know those around you.

Attend Networking Events: Lectures, Career Fairs, and other networking events are a great way to give yourself exposure. Make sure to be yourself when engaging in conversation at these events.

Be Approachable: Keep your head up, walk with good posture, make eye contact, and portray yourself as someone others should make friends with. Try not to wear headphones everywhere you go as it limits your opportunity to 
speak to others.
