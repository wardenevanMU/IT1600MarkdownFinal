# Stay Organized

Organization is a life skill.
Being on top of assignments can reduce stress and keep you grounded.

A few things you can do to stay organized: 
- Use a calendar. Canvas and Blackboard have a built-in customizable calendar. 
- Keep a clean workspace. Each week clean your room or workspace so it doesn't pile up.
- Use File Explorer and physical folders. Organize material by subject for easy retrieval.
- Communicate with teachers. A simple question to your teachers can solve a lot of misunderstandings.
- Prioritize more difficult tasks first.
- Color code your notes.
